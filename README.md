# Connectome Computation System (CCS)

Connectome Computation System (CCS) is designed for Discovery Science of the human brain. 

This branch is **CCS v1.0** for (f)MRI preprocessing, which includes the updates as follow:
-   Add FSL-FAST in structural preprocessing as an option for tissue segmentation
-   The native structural data (intermediate and preprocessed) in mask, reg, segment, and segment_fast subfolders are all in FS conformed space.
-   The functional preprocessed data are organized in func_minimal, func_reg, func_seg, func_nuisance, func_preproc subfolders.

**Source version** of the CCS pipeline is on Github: https://github.com/zuoxinian/CCS.
